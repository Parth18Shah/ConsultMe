## Description ##
<p>
  The lockdown that took place due to the Covid-19 all around the country had some severe impact on people. 
  Most of them were afraid to go outside of their homes. 
  People were reluctant to go even for a routine checkup.
  To provide an effective solution for the same we have created this website.
  Here we have incorporated a Machine learning model which would predict the disease the user might be suffering from, based on the symptoms which they have given as the input     and will also suggest some home remedies and medicines for the same. 
  We will also provide the patient an option to consult with a doctor online to get their expert opinion.
